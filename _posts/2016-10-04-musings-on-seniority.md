What is a "Senior Engineer?" As I've been job-searching around, I've ruminated on this for a while. Most listings are for senior positions, and I've taken to asking the question in every interview and phone call I have: what is a senior engineer?

I once asked some friends, and they told me it was an engineer with experience who can teach others - with most emphasis on teaching.

I asked in a recruiter phone call and he responded that it is an engineer with a breadth of experience, in more than one domain or technology stack.

An interesting [thread on Hacker News][hn0] broke engineers (developers) into three tiers.

With this in mind, I want to put forth my findings on what a Senior Engineer is, generally.

A Senior Engineer can be defined as an employee who fulfills attributes from two distinct pillars, which I shall call *Technical Excellence* and *Sociality*.

## Technical Excellence

Technical Excellence is the actual engineering side of the role - the ability to code. It encompasses both a breadth of experience in multiple platforms and hopefully product types (so, perhaps mobile and server-side work) as well as a depth of knowledge in one of those areas.

Enhancing this is my personal opinion on technical excellence, which is that any solution should satisfy four requirements:

1.   Does it solve the right problem?
2.   Is the solution documented?
3.   Is the solution testable?
4.   Is the solution on-budget and on-time?

First, any solution should *solve the right problem*. I have made the mistake before of writing a very good solution to a problem the business does not have. In the best case this only wastes the time of the engineers and their paycheck during that development. In the worst case this wastes further money and time supporting it. Performing the extra work to have a correct understanding of the business problem is incredibly important, and will set you apart as being a business asset that can self-manage, not a liability in need of hand-holding.

Second, *is the solution documented?* Code needs to be documented, data schemas need their rationale explained, and any ops should have runbooks for bleary-eyed engineers to work from at 3:30 AM when Icinga blows up your phone. Documentation will help you six months from now just as much as it will help your team, it helps in project hand-off when you get reassigned, and it helps ten years from now when someone needs to modify your solution and you've already got two different employers distance from what you wrote.

I cannot state how important a *testable* solution is, 314. Automated testing is of particular interest. You can't always have a CI server, but at the very least learn the testing frameworks for your stack and make good use of them. Being able to hit a button and determine if things are mostly good or very bad is worth every second you spend writing those tests. Tests also help demonstrate the expected use of software to someone who may not be too familiar with it.

Finally, a Senior Engineer can complete tasks both *on-budget and on-time* - or at least recognize when these things are not going to happen, and can raise an exception with superiors when it does happen. This saves time, releases, and can even save your company.

## Sociality

Programming may be about writing code, but engineering as practiced in industry means building something bigger than any single person, and that means having a certain degree of social acumen. Beyond being a clear and reliable communicator, I decided to lump in what I've learned about motivation here as well. This ties in nicely with *Does it solve the right problem?*

A comment reply on [Hacker News][hn0] broke developer levels into three tiers: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior.

> * Junior developer - Will not produce much business value if left alone, and may produce nothing at all. Requires supervision.
> * Intermediate developer - Will produce something if left alone, but not necessarily what the business most needs. Needs minimal supervision, but defined goals.
> * Senior developer - Will produce immediate business value if completely ignored.

Though fairly self-explanatory, the takeaway is that a Senior-level developer looks around the business to see what needs doing, and picks the most important task that isn't already being worked on. This may mean working on things that aren't particularly glamorous or technically interesting. But we have after-hours and forever projects to sate those desires.

I'll note here as well that a good senior engineer is a *teacher*, capable of taking junior and intermediate engineers up to higher levels of productivity and technical excellence.

Well my dear 314, this has been my notes, thoughts, and musing on the topic of developer Seniority as a job description. It's someone who builds the right thing, someone who builds things that others can understand and modify later, and who can teach others to do the same.
